# Warframe-Price-Checker
This uses the playwright module as a web scraping tool to gather data of warframe mod prices on an online marketplace from its loaded page elements, uses async to load multiple pages at once, calculate the profit margin and sort them all from most profitable to least

I've done this much simpler by calling the public API in their frontends network tab, but it was good practice for web scraping
